# MTcGAN for Data Fusion
Master thesis project for a multi temporal cGAN for data fusion on Sentinel's images.

The study moves from [Multi-temporal sentinel-1 and -2 data fusion for optical Image Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09954).

This repository contains the all code needed, with the processing of data too:
- py folder contains the main code, for pre-processing of images, networks building and training;
- plot_data folder has the required scripts used to create the training graphs and plot images for the paper copy;
- docker folder contains the Dockerfile (not tested yet) for a potential deployment on Jetson Xavier.

The digital copy of the thesis work will be uploaded when possible.
